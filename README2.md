# Release Structure
Versions are tagged using semantic versioning. Mass changes are indictated in the first digit, minor functionality updates in the second digit, and big fixes are indicated with the third digit. 

Each release will include a targeted release date for the next version. The author is not required to make these deadlines precisely.
